This project provides a collection of utilities on top of Django's standard auth package and django-otp.
The feature set includes a minimal user model, support for token-based authentication, a simple and relatively boilerplate-free way to define REST APIs with pluggable authentication, and a flexible template-base multilingual mail broadcast mechanism.

More will follow soon(TM).
